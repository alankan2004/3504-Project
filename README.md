## Spreadsheet Data (CSE 3504 Project)
A Python Script that takes data out of spreadsheet and calculate probabilities and statistics to plot graphs using Python Libaries, then make comparision and analysis on the result.


Note: This is an old Python Project I did in my CSE 3504 Probabilistic Performance Analysis of Computer Systems class in Spring 2018.

## What I Used and learned
* Extracting data from spreadsheet using Python.
* Python Libaries: Pandas, NumPy, xlrd, matplotlib, math, statistics.
