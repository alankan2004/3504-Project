## Spreadsheet Data (CSE 3504 Project)
A Python Script that takes data out of spreadsheet and calculate probabilities and statistics to plot graphs using Python Libaries, then make comparision and analysis on the result.


Note: This is an old Python Project I did in my CSE 3504 Probabilistic Performance Analysis of Computer Systems class in Spring 2018.

## Prerequisites
#Python

For Mac OS X Users: https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/

For Windows Users: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

#Libaries
Go to your Terminal or CommandPrompt

‘‘‘
pip install pandas
‘‘‘

If the above command doesn't work and asks for authorization, then use...

‘‘‘
sudo pip install pandas
‘‘‘

And we repeat this step for the other libaries.

## What I Used and learned
* Extracting data from spreadsheet using Python.
* Python Libaries: Pandas, NumPy, xlrd, matplotlib, math, statistics.
